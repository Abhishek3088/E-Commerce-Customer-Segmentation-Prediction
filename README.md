# E-Commerce-Customer-Segmentation-Prediction
This project applies RFM analysis and clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN) to segment e-commerce customers based on purchasing behavior. It helps identify high-value customers, at-risk buyers, and growth opportunities, enabling businesses to optimize marketing strategies and improve customer retention. 🚀📊

# 🛍️ E-commerce Customer Segments and Prediction  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **segmenting e-commerce customers** using **RFM analysis and clustering techniques (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN)** to uncover insights into customer behavior. By analyzing purchasing patterns, the model helps businesses identify **high-value customers, at-risk buyers, and growth opportunities**, enabling data-driven marketing strategies.
